                        <p class="info">Music is a universal language. It brings us joy, recalls memories, encourages us to
                        dance. Our music listening habits reflect our lives: what time of year it is, what mood we're in,
                        what language we speak, how energetic we may be. <br>
                        This is why we're interested in exploring music data. ... </p>

                        <p class="info">For this project, we're using Spotify data. With
                            <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/companyinfo/">191 million active users</a> across 61 countries
                        featuring over 40 million songs, Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services in the
                        world. <br><br>
                            Embedded in each song's metadata is information about the song's energy, valence (happiness), tempo,
                        key, danceability, and much more. Each of these characteristics has a rating from 0 to 1 and the numbers
                        help Spotify understand its users. We're focusing on these metrics to explore similarities and differences
                        in popular music around the world. Our songs are gathered from the Spotify-generated "Top 50" playlists of
                            each of the 61 countries Spotify serves (e.g. Argentina's Top 50, etc.). <br><br>
                        This data is a snapshot of these playlists as of November 2018. As Spotify reaches a broader audience,
                        it can tell us more and more about the world's music tastes. <strong>For now, we can only gather information
                        about the 61 countries highlighted on the map below. </strong></p>

                            <b>Danceability</b> describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical
                            elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Valence</b> describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
                            Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with
                            low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Speechiness</b> detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like
                            the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Loudness</b> is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical
                            strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 decibels.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Acousticness</b> is a confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0
                            represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
                            <br><br>

                <h3>Take a closer look at how your country compares...</h3>
                <p class="info">Now that you've seen the broader trends around the world, let's look at how your country compares to others
                around the world in more detail. Can you find the country that's most similar to yours? Most different?
                Perhaps you've been travelling lately, or just have dreams of future travels. How do the countries you want to
                visit compare to your own in average music taste?
                    <br><br>
                There may be deeper value in considering these comparisons than you think. While the average American
                Spotify listener may be quite different from the average Indonesian Spotify listener, the energy and valence
                of the most popular songs for those countries are very similar. Take Reggaeton as an example. According to
                Spotify <a href="https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/09/05/how-reggaeton-became-a-global-phenomenon-on-spotify/">data</a>,
                    reggaeton's share of music on Spotify grew 119% from 2014 to 2017, compared to pop's growth of
                13% and country music's growth of 4%. Following that trend, more songs from around the world borrowed reggaeton's
                catchy beat, including the massive Ed Sheeran hit "Shape of You." This suggests that the world may share more
                music tastes than we recognize.

                        From these visualizations we can recognize the universality of music. Each country has its own idiosyncrasies; no two are the same.
                        Some songs, like Ariana Grande's "thank u, next" are in nearly every country's Top 50, yet tracks of many languages and aural characteristics
                        contribute to the unique nation-to-nation differences. While the Top 50 chart is not representative of an entire country's music taste,
                        these visualizations help us study the formula for what makes a song popular in any given country.
